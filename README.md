Scientific Hierarchies in Scholarly Collaboration Networks Since 1990: Evidence from OpenAlex
Estevão Macedo presented our study, "Scientific Hierarchies in Scholarly Collaboration Networks Since 1990: Evidence from OpenAlex," at the international conference Complex Networks Beyond Pairwise Interactions: From Theory to Applications, held in Natal, Brazil. 
Drawing on graph theory to explore academic mobility and scientific collaboration, our study examines institutional collaboration networks across the most productive scientific fields, using data from OpenAlex.
I would like to thank Estevão Macedo, Alysson Mazoni, PhD, and Esteban Tuesta for their valuable contributions to the project. We are also deeply grateful to Bruno Fischer, Jesús Mena-Chalco, CAPES, Unicamp, FAPESP, and the InSySPo project for their generous support.
